Runtime
-------

1. When calculating the Big O notation for a particular algorithm, it's necessary
to consider the length of time it takes for the algorithm to run as the algorithm's
workload approaches infinity. What determines the **workload** of figuring out
whether your box of animal crackers contains an elephant?  How many animal crackers are in the box.




2. Order the following runtimes in descending order of efficiency (that is,
	fastest runtimes first, slowest last) as `n` approaches infinity:

   - O(log n) 2

   - O(n^2) 5

   - O(n log n) 4

   - O(n) 3

   - O(2^n) 6

   - O(1) 1


In the file called `runtime.py`, there are 5 functions.

1. What is the runtime for `string_compare`? O(n) 

2. What is the runtime for `has_exotic_animals`? O(n) 

3. What is the runtime for `sum_zero_1`? O(n^2) ANSWER -> O(n) ************

4. What is the runtime for `sum_zero_2`? O(n^2)

5. What is the runtime for `sum_zero_3`? O(n^2) ANSWER -> O(n^3) ************


Stacks and Queues
-----------------

1. In the following cases, would a stack or queue be a more appropriate data
	structure?

  - The process of loading and unloading pallets onto a flatbed truck - stack

  - Putting bottle caps on bottles of beer as they roll down an assembly line - queue


2. Describe two more situations where a queue would be an appropriate data
	structure.

3. Describe two more situations where a stack would be an appropriate data
	structure.


Linked Lists
------------

1. Given the linked list shown in the instructions, which are the nodes? What is
the data for each node? Where is the head? Where is the tail? (Be as specific as
possible --- exactly which parts of the diagram correspond to each part? Arrows?
Boxes? Text?)

2. What's the difference between doubly- and singly-linked lists? 
- singly linked lists use 'next'. 
-doubly linked lists - use 'next' and 'prev'

3. Why is it faster to append to a linked list if we keep track of the `tail`
as an attribute? we don't have to 'next' through the whole list to get there.

Trees
-----

1. What would be the best data structure to use for keeping track of nodes to
	visit during a Breadth First Search of a tree?

	visit during a Depth First Search of a tree?
